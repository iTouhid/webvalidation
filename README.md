Web validation plugin in jQuery

HOW TO USE IT
-------------
Please follow the validation.php on the root folder. To use webvalidationv1.0 you just only need to  include webvalidation.1.0.js. If you want to show error differently you just need to do the corresponding  error div with [INPUT_ID]-error. More feature will come in future.
